This tests grep, and non-standard variants egrep (equiv. to grep -E) and fgrep
(equiv. to grep -F). For now, the tests are done with fgrep since regular
expressions aren't implemented yet.

Set up
    # cd /tmp
    # echo Ant >animals
    # echo Anteater >>animals
    # echo Baboon >>animals
    # echo Cat >>animals
    # echo Dog >>animals
    # echo Egret >>animals
    # echo Apple >fruit
    # echo Banana >>fruit
    # echo Cantaloupe >>fruit

Testing basic matching, -v, -i and -x flags
    # fgrep Ant animals
    Ant
    Anteater

    # fgrep -v Ant animals
    Baboon
    Cat
    Dog
    Egret

    # fgrep ant animals

    # fgrep -i ant animals
    Ant
    Anteater

    # fgrep -x Ant animals
    Ant

Testing output options
    # fgrep -n o animals
    3:Baboon
    5:Dog
    
    # fgrep o animals fruit
    animals:Baboon
    animals:Dog
    fruit:Cantaloupe
    
    # fgrep -n o animals fruit
    animals:3:Baboon
    animals:5:Dog
    fruit:3:Cantaloupe
    
Testing count output mode
    # fgrep -c o animals fruit
    animals:2
    fruit:1
    
    # fgrep -c Ant animals fruit
    animals:2
    fruit:0
    
    # fgrep -c Ant animals
    2

Testing file output mode    
    # fgrep -l o animals fruit
    animals
    fruit
    
    # fgrep -l Ant animals fruit
    animals
    
    # fgrep -l Ant animals
    animals

Testing quite output mode
    # fgrep -q o animals; echo $?
    0
    
    # fgrep -q x animals; echo $?
    1
    
    # fgrep -q o animals fruit; echo $?
    0
    
    # fgrep -q Cant animals fruit; echo $?
    0
    
    # fgrep -q x animals fruit; echo $?
    1

Testing standard input
    # fgrep Ant <animals
    Ant
    Anteater
    
    # fgrep o - fruit <animals
    (standard input):Baboon
    (standard input):Dog
    fruit:Cantaloupe
    
    # fgrep -l Ant <animals 
    (standard input)
    
    # fgrep -l Cant animals - <fruit
    (standard input)
    
Clean-up
N.B.: Need some tests after a stdin relocation test, or things fail!
TODO: Fix this!
    # rm -f animals fruit
