Parameter expansion tests - ยง2.6.2

Simple tests
    # a=aardvark
    # echo $a ${a} x$a x${a}x
    aardvark aardvark xaardvark xaardvarkx

Within double quotes - ยง2.2.3
    # echo "$a" "${a}" "x$a" "x${a}x"
    aardvark aardvark xaardvark xaardvarkx

Unset, set to null, and set to something
    # nothing=''
    # something='apple'
    # recho "$unknown" "$nothing" "$something"
    argv[1] = <>

    argv[2] = <>
    argv[3] = <apple>

Length operator
    # echo "${#unknown}" "${#nothing}" "${#something}"
    0 0 5

Use default operator
    # recho "${unknown-pear}" "${nothing-pear}" "${something-pear}"
    argv[1] = <pear>
    argv[2] = <>
    argv[3] = <apple>

Use alternate operator

Indicate error operator

    unknown: one
    # : "${unknown:?one}" "${nothing:?two}" "${something:?three}"   # ONLY plush

Assign default operator
