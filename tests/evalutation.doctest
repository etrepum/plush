Eval command feeds it's arguments, as a string back into the shell

Eval of no arguments and strings of spaces
    # eval && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    # eval '' && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    # eval ' ' && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    # eval '' '' && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    # eval '    ' '' '     ' && echo ok || echo fail
    ok

Eval of simple commands
    # eval echo hi
    hi

Arguments are re-parsed
    # recho 'hi there'
    argv[1] = <hi there>
    # eval recho 'hi there'
    argv[1] = <hi>
    argv[2] = <there>

Return value is that of the command
    # eval true && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    # eval false && echo ok || echo fail
    fail

Execution is in the context of the current shell
    # x=1
    # echo $x
    1
    # eval 'x=2'
    # echo $x
    2
