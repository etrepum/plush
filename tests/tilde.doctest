Tilde Expansion -- ยง 2.6.1

Bare tildes expand as $HOME -- we can for set that to make this test consistent
    # HOME=/expand/here
    # echo ~
    /expand/here
    
    # echo ~/extra
    /expand/here/extra
    
    # echo nope/~ a~z
    nope/~ a~z
    
    # echo '~'
    ~
    
    # echo nope:~
    nope:~
    
Tildes followed by a name expand as that account's home dir. For testing we
have to take a somewhat circuitous route, since while the account nobody likely
exists on all systems, where its home dir is location is not standard.
    # NHD=~nobody
    # echo ~nobody | fgrep -q $NHD && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    
    # echo ~nobody/extra | fgrep -q $NHD/extra && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    
    # echo nope/~nobody anybody~nobody
    nope/~nobody anybody~nobody
    
    # echo '~'nobody ~\nobody ~nobody\/foo
    ~nobody ~nobody ~nobody/foo
    
    # echo nope:~nobody
    nope:~nobody

    If your system has an account named qzdqinvlq, this test will fail
    # echo ~qzdqinvlq
    ~qzdqinvlq

When setting variables, tilde expansion is performed on each colon separated
part of the setting.
    # t=a:~:b ; echo $t
    a:/expand/here:b
    
    # t=a:~/extra:b ; echo $t
    a:/expand/here/extra:b
    
    # t=~:~:~ ; echo $t
    /expand/here:/expand/here:/expand/here
    
    # t=a\:~:b ; echo $t
    a:~:b
    
    # t=a:~nobody:b ; echo $t | fgrep -q a:$NHD:b && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    
    # t=a:~nobody/extra:b
    # echo $t | fgrep -q a:$NHD/extra:b && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    
    # t=~nobody:~nobody:~nobody
    # echo $t | fgrep -q $NHD:$NHD:$NHD && echo ok || echo fail
    ok
    
    # t=a:~\nobody:b ; echo $t
    a:~nobody:b
    
    # t=a:~nobody\:b ; echo $t
    a:~nobody:b
    
Tilde expansion results are subject to pathname expansion
    # HOME=/tmp/lodge
    # cd /tmp
    # mkdir lodge
    # cd lodge
    # touch apple avacado banana
    # cd /
    # echo ~/a*
    /tmp/lodge/apple /tmp/lodge/avacado
    
Tilde expansion is not subject to field splitting
    # IFS=' /'
    # recho ~/banana
    argv[1] = </tmp/lodge/banana>

Clean up
    # cd /tmp
    # rm -rf lodge
