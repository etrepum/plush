[] plumb history fetch to Job
[] return fixed history from a parsed JSON string

[] change who picks job names
[] store history

[] convert from ReportOne to Report interfaces


idea one:
    let front end name jobs
    backend stores in history via it's own ids, but reports in front-end names
    for history reporting, generates yet different front-end job names

    shell will have to keep a history counter
    already keeps front end jobs
    need a way to indicate when a job shouldn't be stored in history
    shell has to find / make history directory when it starts
    shell has to inventory previous history entries to both find new starting
        point, as well as giving front end a way to know what there is

$HOME/.plush/session/history/cmd-<date>.<time>.<n>-<cmd>

[] on start up
    mkdir -p $HOME/.plush/session/history
    -- in future need to do some interlock of some sort
    ls -l > history list
    (old, history) <- splitFromBack 500 historyList
    rm old
    initialize counter to last entry of history (or "")

[] front end request "history prior to"
    starting at newest command, read command file, parse
        add to return status
        while return size is rational
    if more to do


[] locking:
    fd <- openefile...
    setLock fd (WriteLock, AbsoluteSeek, 0, 0)
    -- throws if can't set
    -- if anyone ever closes that file (not that fd!) the lock is lost


TASKS
------
[] stamps
    [x] build stamp prefix from time
    [] save last used prefix, count
    [] if new == last, bump count
    [] file name from time+count+santized(cmd)
[x] on start up, mkdir -p $HOME/.plush/session/history
[] remove 'running: false' from FinishItem

-----------
[] on start up get filelist from history dir
[x] on history request
    [x] read each file, reply with items


[] command lines with parser errors should produce a different entry in the
   history file than just a simple stderr line









[x] split command info and output into separate files
   - 20121105.1134.0.cmd & 20121105.1134.0.out
[x] ship just commands on history request
[x] request for output for a command in history
   [x] back-end API end point for requesting
   [x] front-end request ouptut ... as user opens? last 6 hours? until a gap?

[] add time and working directory to command file



[] add command to "all-time" command list

[] kill output on full-screen
   [] back-end API for killing output
   [] send kill-output on entering full-screen
   [] handle missing output file gracefully
   [] commands without output should not be deferred, but be in some no-output state



API or just built-in command?

history list:
    find dir -- won't match what job is doing exactly, will it!
    enumerate dir -- easy
    read contents -- easy
    return as JSON -- easy if we don't parse it as [HistoryItem]

history output:
    find file -- easy
    return as JSON -- easy if we don't parse it as [OutputItem]

kill output:
    find file -- easy
    delete -- easy
    sync to job system no longer recording -- hard

kill command
    find files -- easy
    delete - easy
    sync to job system no longer recording -- hard

[x] entering history search should focus on command line if needed
[x] return should enter current focus into command line
[x] ensure that focused entry is always scrolled into view
[x] better css
    [-] for when in history mode
    [x] for the focused item
[x] corner cases better
    [x] when the selection goes empty shouldn't loose focus place
    [x] when focus at bottom with dir 1 goes out of match, then back in
[x] bindings
    [x] should ESC key enter or cancel - cancel
    [x] should ALT+/ and ALT+\ enter history search - yes
    [x] what key should be bound to clear the search field - C-u

[] scroll list so that it is at bottom, not top of screen

[-] animate hiding/showing of output ?
[-] display focused entry overlaid onto command line ala completion ?
[-] restore commandline on cancel search?


From readline's History UI
    C-r : incremental search backward
    C-s : incremental search forward
        -- these both start the search, and continue in the direction given
    esc, C-j : terminate search, inserting c71urrent match
    C-g : cancel search, inserts nothing
    <character> : enters into text field, narrows search
    <bs>, <del> : delete in text field, widens search


    c-p, c-n : prev/next in history -- our opt-up, opt-down
    M-<, M-> : begin/end of history
    M-p, M-n : non-incremental search back/forward
    M-C-y : yank n-th arg
    M-., M-_ : yank last arg
